# twitterMiddleEastSentimentAnalyis
Python program to scrape tweets given any time period, geo location, langauge, or key words. Uploads returned tweets to a local csv file with sentiment analysis performed by textBlob in addition to other metadata about each tweet. 


copy_of_MiddleEast_Twitter_Analysis.ipynb is an earlier hacky example I used for a Middle East sentiment analysis. 

However, a more user friendly, general API is in the twitterSentimentAnalysisAPI.ipynb. 

Personal Twitter API credentials are necessary. In terms of directions on how to use, the comments are self-explanatory.
