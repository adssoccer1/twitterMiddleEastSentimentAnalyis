# twitterMiddleEastSentimentAnalyis
Python program to scrape tweets given any time period, geo location, langauge, and key words. Uploads returned tweets to a local csv file with sentiment analysis performed by textBlob. 


An earlier hacked example I used for an an Middle East sentiment analysis is in copy_of_MiddleEast_Twitter_Analysis.ipynb

The more user friendly general API is in the twitterSentimentAnalysisAPI.ipynb. 

Personal Twitter API credentials are necessary.
